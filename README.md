Hi, I'm Ian Jason C. Etruiste and this is my submission for the technical exam or Interface Development Test.

For this exam I decided to not use any frontend framework or library to further showcase my skills without using the tools to make development easier.

You can check the output of my work by opening the index.html inside the src folder. 

The rest of the code base is also found in the src folder for the css and javascript used. 

You can find the images, fonts and icon useed in the Assets folder.
